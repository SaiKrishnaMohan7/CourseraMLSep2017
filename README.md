# Machine Learning Coursera Sep 2017

This is the course work for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

### Experience
* A lot of fun but was quite challenging with commiting time and brushing up on concepts I had forgotten.

* This course cleas the basic concepts of ML and NN's.

* There are quite a few errors ib the lecture videos so keeping an eye on the Resources section of the course is very important.

### Next Steps
* Reimplement this in Python and then sign up for either Fast.ai or deeplearning.ai

* Read up a lot more and implement small projects
